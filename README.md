## Getting To Know You

This app is a simple iOS app written in Swift that has text and a button. The button
is connected to a function that will change the text whenever it is clicked.

This app was written during a three hour introduction to iOS programming class with
Swift, taught by guest speaker Yong Bakos at the [Turing School of Software & Design](http://turing.io).
